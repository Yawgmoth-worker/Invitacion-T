# Texture Challenge - Pen #9 - 2020

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/abOOXbv](https://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/abOOXbv).

I wanted to do something fun for the Codepen challenge this week. I went with a wedding invite layout. 

It's a fun layout with loads of color, a few images overlaid, and some good typography. 

I was inspired by a Dribbble by Bailey Sullivan.
